# Project Screenshots

This directory contains project screenshots, particularly for mobile apps.

## Structure

```
png/
  projects/
    mobile-app-1/
      screenshot-home.png
      screenshot-feature-1.png
      screenshot-feature-2.png
    mobile-app-2/
      ...
```

## Guidelines

- Create a subdirectory for each project
- Use descriptive filenames for each screenshot
- For mobile apps, use 1080x1920px (9:16) resolution
- Compress images before adding them
- Use PNG for UI screenshots to preserve text clarity

See PROJECT_IMAGES_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
