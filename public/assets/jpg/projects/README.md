# Project Images

This directory contains project images organized by project name.

## Structure

```
jpg/
  projects/
    project-name-1/
      thumbnail.jpg
      image-1.jpg
      image-2.jpg
    project-name-2/
      ...
```

## Guidelines

- Create a subdirectory for each project
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `dashboard-view.jpg`, not `img1.jpg`)
- Compress images before adding them
- Use JPG for photos and complex images
- Keep file sizes under 200KB when possible

See PROJECT_IMAGES_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions.
