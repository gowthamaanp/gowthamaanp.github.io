**Standing Invitation**

Taking inspiration from [Matthew Palmer](https://matthewpalmer.net/), I have a standing invitation for you to reach out to me about anything that's on your mind. My email is gowthamaan.mail@gmail.com - that’s the best way to get in contact with me. If I don’t respond, feel free to DM me on my LinkedIn.

**Emails I Enjoy Receiving:**

- Discussions on AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.
- Feedback on product design, particularly where technology meets user experience.
- Collaborations or ideas in Medical Image Analysis and Computer Vision.
- Questions or challenges in Python, Django, or Flutter development.
- Non-technical chats about hobbies, niche interests, or book recommendations.

**The Deal:**

**Will definitely get a response:**

- You send me a personally written email about something that clearly matters to you.
- You seek feedback on an AI/ML project or idea.
- You want my thoughts or help on a Python or Flutter application, medical image analysis or computer vision.
- You have a unique hobby or interest you’d like to discuss.
- You have a book recommendation (I love getting book recommendations).
- Requests for coding assistance (I might not always have time, but I’ll do my best).

**Will not get a response:**

- I’m clearly on some kind of list
- Bulk or spam emails.
- Requests to participate in surveys or unsolicited promotions.
- Vague requests for help without specific context.

**Important!** Don’t apologize for contacting me — avoiding that is the whole purpose of giving you an engraved invitation. If I don’t respond, I apologize in advance; it was me, not you. If I don’t respond within a week, feel free to send a follow-up email. I might have been busy when your email arrived. If you follow up and ask me to reply, I’ll make a genuine effort to get back to you.

**Don’t Know How to Start?**

Here’s your opening line…
